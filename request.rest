### How to obtain `postId` / `commentId`

1. Run the **Posts — Create** request. The response body includes the created post's `_id`.
2. Run the **Comments — Create (for post)** request (it will return the created comment with `_id`).
3. Copy the returned `_id` values and store them in a Rest Client environment file so placeholders work automatically.

Create a file named `rest-client.env.json` in the workspace root (used by the REST Client extension) and paste:

```json
{
  "local": {
    "postId": "PASTE_POST_ID_HERE",
    "commentId": "PASTE_COMMENT_ID_HERE"
  }
}
```

Then select the `local` environment in the REST Client and the `{{postId}}` / `{{commentId}}` placeholders will be substituted.
